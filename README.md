# Playwright Pet Project

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project is a personal pet project created to practice and demonstrate my skills in end-to-end UI testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It features test coverage for SauceDemo.com as a QA practice project and is an ongoing effort where I am actively adding new features and improvements.

The project is being refactored to use TypeScript to leverage type safety and modern coding practices.
